    "## Summary\n",
    "The notebook's primary function is to transform a dataset of song lyrics from simple text to a structured multi-task learning dataset, suitable for teaching a model both phoneme recognition and couplet generation. Starting with a .csv file, it cleans the data and then transforms the song lyrics into discrete lines. These lines are then paired into rhyming couplets. The culmination of the notebook's process is the creation of a dataset that serves dual purposes: it facilitates phoneme-to-grapheme translation (and vice versa) and bridges the first line to the second in couplets. This dual-purpose dataset is instrumental for the model to not only anticipate the subsequent line in a couplet but also to comprehend the rhythm and meter inherent in the song lyrics, attributed to the phonemic patterns."
